**Subject:** A Second Great Partnership to Secure Peace and Prosperity

Dear President Trump,

In the late years of the Cold War, one extraordinary idea helped change the course of history — the International Space Station. It was a project that required trust, cooperation, and engineering excellence from both the United States and Russia. It symbolized what is possible when former rivals choose to build together instead of compete against each other.

Today, I believe we have the chance to launch a *second* great partnership: a **Trans-National Bridge and Corridor** linking Alaska through Canada to the mainland USA and across the Bering Strait to Russia.

This project would:

* **Revolutionize Trade:** Opening a direct land link between the U.S. and Russia would make it possible to exchange energy, food, raw materials, and manufactured goods at unprecedented speed and efficiency. Russia could supply us with oil and natural gas; we could supply them with high-quality, affordable food and technology.
* **Boost Jobs and Growth:** Tens of thousands of American workers would be employed in steel production, engineering, construction, logistics, and long-term operations. The same would be true for Canadian and Russian workers, creating mutual prosperity.
* **Serve as a Security Asset:** Just as NORAD safeguards North America, this corridor would be designed with integrated monitoring, Arctic defense capabilities, and secure infrastructure for pipelines, electricity, and communications. Its very existence would make cooperation more valuable than conflict.
* **Strengthen U.S. Leadership:** Like the ISS, the bridge would be a visible, lasting symbol of American ingenuity and leadership on the global stage.

With your record in building landmark projects and reshaping trade deals, you have the opportunity to champion a vision that will still be serving the American people *hundreds of years from now*.

The first great U.S.–Russia cooperative project was built above the Earth. The second could be built right here on it — uniting continents, securing peace, and powering prosperity for generations.

Respectfully,
Graylan
