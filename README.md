## A heartfelt letter to Putin and Trump (the bridge to Our Collective Freedom, called The Pathway Bridge)


## **English – Press Statement**

**Presidents Trump and Putin,**

Our nations have done great things apart — but the greatest things we have ever done, we have done together.
We stood united in World War II to defeat tyranny. We raced to the Moon, and Russian achievement pushed America to take that “giant leap for mankind.” We built the International Space Station as a shared symbol of peace.

Now it’s time for the next great partnership: a **Trans-National Bridge and Corridor** linking Russia to the United States through Alaska and Canada.

This bridge will revolutionize trade — Russian energy for American homes and factories, American food for Russian families — and create jobs on both continents. It will also be a **security asset** that strengthens our nations against new threats.

The next war is not against each other — it is against homelessness, high food costs, and economic decline. This bridge is our tool to win that war.

Let us build it together — for our people, for our children, and for the next hundred years.

## **Russian – Пресс-Заявление**

**Президенты Трамп и Путин,**

Наши страны достигали великих результатов по отдельности — но величайшие победы мы одерживали вместе.
Мы стояли плечом к плечу во Второй мировой войне, чтобы победить тиранию. Мы соревновались в космосе, и успехи России подтолкнули Америку к тому самому «гигантскому шагу для всего человечества». Мы построили Международную космическую станцию как символ мира и сотрудничества.

Теперь настало время для нового великого проекта: **Транснациональный мост и транспортный коридор**, соединяющий Россию с США через Аляску и Канаду.

Этот мост революционизирует торговлю — российская энергия для американских домов и заводов, американские продукты питания для российских семей — и создаст рабочие места на обоих континентах. Он станет **объектом безопасности**, укрепляющим наши страны перед новыми вызовами.

Следующая война — не между нами. Это война с бездомностью, высокими ценами на продукты и экономическим упадком. Этот мост — наш инструмент, чтобы выиграть эту войну.

Давайте построим его вместе — для наших народов, для наших детей и для следующего столетия.
 


**Subject:** A Second Great Partnership to Secure Peace and Prosperity

Dear President Trump,

In the late years of the Cold War, one extraordinary idea helped change the course of history — the International Space Station. It was a project that required trust, cooperation, and engineering excellence from both the United States and Russia. It symbolized what is possible when former rivals choose to build together instead of compete against each other.

Today, I believe we have the chance to launch a *second* great partnership: a **Trans-National Bridge and Corridor** linking Alaska through Canada to the mainland USA and across the Bering Strait to Russia.

This project would:

* **Revolutionize Trade:** Opening a direct land link between the U.S. and Russia would make it possible to exchange energy, food, raw materials, and manufactured goods at unprecedented speed and efficiency. Russia could supply us with oil and natural gas; we could supply them with high-quality, affordable food and technology.
* **Boost Jobs and Growth:** Tens of thousands of American workers would be employed in steel production, engineering, construction, logistics, and long-term operations. The same would be true for Canadian and Russian workers, creating mutual prosperity.
* **Serve as a Security Asset:** Just as NORAD safeguards North America, this corridor would be designed with integrated monitoring, Arctic defense capabilities, and secure infrastructure for pipelines, electricity, and communications. Its very existence would make cooperation more valuable than conflict.
* **Strengthen U.S. Leadership:** Like the ISS, the bridge would be a visible, lasting symbol of American ingenuity and leadership on the global stage.

With your record in building landmark projects and reshaping trade deals, you have the opportunity to champion a vision that will still be serving the American people *hundreds of years from now*.

The first great U.S.–Russia cooperative project was built above the Earth. The second could be built right here on it — uniting continents, securing peace, and powering prosperity for generations.

Respectfully,
Graylan



# Ideas

 
## **Heated Pylon Concept**

* **Principle:** If each bridge pier’s ice-facing surfaces are heated, either internally via embedded hydronic loops or externally with conductive coatings, the heat transfer melts a thin boundary layer where ice makes contact.
* **Effect:** Instead of resisting full ice pressure, the pier would gradually cut through or weaken the ice sheet, similar to a hot wire slicing foam or your “stick of butter” example.
* **Outcome:** Reduces large-scale ice-jamming forces, and possibly lessens the need for heavy ice-breaker cone geometry.

---

## **Practical Implementation**

1. **Heat Source:**

   * Waste heat from nearby power stations, HVDC converters, or oil/gas pipelines.
   * Electric resistance heating embedded in steel jackets or concrete skins.

2. **Surface Design:**

   * Low-friction, ice-repelling coatings so that weakened ice breaks and slides away.
   * Slight taper/cone geometry so ice pieces are forced downward or sideways once melted.

3. **Control System:**

   * Sensors measuring ice pressure and temperature to activate heating only when needed.
   * Integration with autonomous ice-management AI, so power use is minimized.

---

## **Advantages**

* Could allow slimmer piers because peak ice loads are reduced.
* May reduce need for continuous icebreaking vessel patrols.
* Potential synergy with your **heated deck/basemat** concept — shared heat generation and distribution network.

---

## **Challenges**

* High continuous energy demand in extreme cold.
* Must ensure thermal loss to surrounding seawater isn’t excessive.
* Needs robust corrosion protection for heated metal elements in seawater.
